=head1 NAME

ncm-dpmlfc : NCM component to manage DPM and LFC configuration.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This component allows to manage configuration of DPM and LFC services, with the exception of DPM xrootd protocol which is managed by 
the ncm-xrootd configuration module.

Configuration module B<ncm-dpmlfc> requires that the DPM and/or LFC configuration describes all nodes participating to the service and their respective 
role (in term of daemon running on each node). Each daemon/host combination is called a daemon instance in this documentation.

Using the whole DPM and/or LFC description, B<ncm-dpmlfc> takes care of action needed on every node to configure it as requested 
(you MUST use the same configuration description on every node participating to DPM and/or LFC). This includes restarting 
a service after configuration changes if needed.

There are 2 sets of configuration options:

=over

=item Global options

There is one separate set for DPM and LFC, C</software/components/dpmlfc/options/dpm> and C</software/components/dpmlfc/options/lfc> respectively. In each set,
there is a subset, C<db>, describing the database and database connection options.

=item Protocol options

For each access or management protocol, there is one set of global options under C</software/components/dpmlfc/protocols>. Each option defined in these sets
can be superseded in the node-specific options for the given protocol.

=back

Following sections describe each option by group of related options.

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS (DPM and LFC)

DPM and LFC accept the same global options but there is a separate set for each one. Replace C<PRODUCT> by C<dpm> or C<lfc>.

=over

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/accessProtocols : list (optional, DPM only)

List of access protocols supported on disk servers. Supported protocols are : https, gsiftp, rfio, xroot.
Note that xrootd configuration itself, including the DPM/Xrootd plug-in, must be configured with
ncm-xrootd.

Default: None (default configuration provided by RPM will be used)

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/controlProtocols : list (optional, DPM only)

List of control protocols supported. Supported protocols are : srmv1, srmv2, srmv2.2.

Default: None (default configuration provided by RPM will be used)

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/gridmapfile

This option defines the local gridmap file used by products daemons. 

Default: None (default configuration provided by RPM will be used)

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/gridmapdir

This option defines the gridmap dir used by products daemons. 

Default: None (default configuration provided by RPM will be used)

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/group

This option defines the userid used by product daemons. 

Default: None (default configuration provided by RPM will be used)

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/user

This option defines the userid used by product daemons. 

Default: dpmmgr for DPM, lfcmgr for LFC

=back

=head1 DATABASE CONNECTION OPTIONS (DPM and LFC)

DPM and LFC accepts the same set of options to describe the database connection. In the following option names, 
replace C<PRODUCT> by either C<dpm> or C<lfc>. Both sets can coexist.

=over

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/db/configfile

This option defines the file used to keep track of database connection information. This file will be owned by the userid used to run daemons and only this user will have access to this file.

Default : /etc/DPMCONFIG for DPM, /etc/NSCONFIG for LFC

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/db/infoFile (string, optional)

Name (without path) of the file containing connection information to DPM DB to be used by GIP to collect information about DPM.
This file will be owned and accessible only by GIP user.

This file will not be created if C<infoUser> is not defined.

Default : DPMINFO for DPM, LFCINFO for LFC.

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/db/infoPwd (string, optional)

Password for database connection account used by GIP to collect information about DPM

Default : generated password. It is recommended to use this default value (password changed at each run).

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/db/infoUser (string, optional)

Username for database connection account used by GIP to collect information about DPM. If this option
is not defined, the infoFile is not updated by B<ncm-dpmlfc>.

Default : None

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/db/password (string, required)

This option defines the password used to connect to the database.

Default : none

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/db/server (string, optional)

This option defines the server running the database. This component checks that
DPM and LFC database server run on different node (DPNS and LFC use the same database name). 
C<localhost> is considered different as DPNS and LFC are not allowed to run on the same node. 

Default : localhost.

=item /software/components/dpmlfc/options/PRODUCT/db/user

This option defines the userid used to connect to the database.

Default : userid used to run daemons

=back

=head1 PROTOCOL OPTIONS (DPM and LFC)

Each access or management protocol has its specific set of global options under C</software/components/dpmlfc/protocols> (e.g. C<dpm>, C<dpns>, C<srmv22>, C<dav>...).
Each of these options can be redefined in the node-specific options for the corresponding protocol. Node specific options are specified as a nlist attached to
the node name. This allows configuration options to be different for each host running an instance of the service but it is
generally not sensible to use a different value for each host.

See the schema, for the complete list of supported options for each protocols. Main options are described here.

=head2 WebDav options

All WebDav options are optional and thus have no default value. To see the value used when the
option is undefined, look at F</etc/httpd/conf.d/zlcgdm-dav.conf>
